# Retail Sales Analysis

### Project Overview
Management seeks to gain comprehensive insights into the sales activities of the company from 2016 to 2018. This includes understanding trends and patterns that can inform strategic decisions. Detailed information on revenue generated per region, store, product category, and brand is essential. Additionally, identifying top customers and sales representatives will provide valuable insights into performance and opportunities for targeted improvements.

### Data Acquisition
To address the business problem and meet the stated objectives, I need to acquire and compile the correct dataset.
I will start by acquiring data from the company's sales database. This is an MS SQL Database.
- Data Points Required
  - order_id, customer name, city, state, order_date, total_unit, revenue, product_name, category_name,brand_name, store_name, sale_rep

These data points are dispersed accross various tables, and requires me to write SQL queries to extract the relevant sales, revenue, and customer data from the companyâ€™s databases.


### Tools
- Excel
- SQL Server
- Power BI
- Tableau

### Data Preparation 
- In the initial preparation phase I performed the follwing tasks:
  1. Data loading and inspection
  2. Handling missing values
  3. Normalization, cleaning and formatting

### Exploratory Data Analysis
- Which year performed the best over the period?
- What product category and brand performed and did not perform well?
- Which state outperformed their counterparts?
- Top sales representative per region?

### Data Analytics
This code was used to retrive the data points required to create the dataset, joins on various tables with relevant primary keys on the company's SQL Server Database:

```Sql
SELECT 
ord.order_id,
CONCAT(cus.first_name,' ', cus.last_name) AS 'customers',
cus.city,
cus.state,
ord.order_date,
SUM(ite.quantity) AS 'total_units',
SUM(ite.quantity * ite.list_price) AS 'revenue',
pro.product_name,
cat.category_name,
sto.store_name,
CONCAT(sta.first_name,' ',sta.last_name) AS 'sales_rep'
FROM sales.orders ord
JOIN sales.customers cus
ON ord.customer_id = cus.customer_id
JOIN sales.order_items ite
ON ord.order_id = ite.order_id
JOIN production.products pro
ON ite.product_id = pro.product_id
JOIN production.categories cat
ON pro.category_id = cat.category_id
JOIN sales.stores sto
ON ord.store_id = sto.store_id
JOIN sales.staffs sta
ON ord.staff_id = sta.staff_id
GROUP BY
ord.order_id,
CONCAT(cus.first_name,' ', cus.last_name),
cus.city,
cus.state,
ord.order_date,
pro.product_name,
cat.category_name,
sto.store_name,
CONCAT(sta.first_name,' ',sta.last_name)
```
### Results 
From an exploratory analysis of the sales data for the period 2016-2018, it appears that 2017 was the best performing year in terms of overall sales and revenue. During this period, mountain bikes emerged as the top product category, reflecting strong consumer demand. Geographically, New York stood out as the highest performing state, contributing significantly to the company's revenue. Among the individual stores, Baldwin Bike distinguished itself as the top performer, leading in sales and customer satisfaction. These insights highlight key areas of success and provide an exploratory view of the current dataset.

To create a dashboard that provides insights into the top UK YouTubers in 2024 that includes their

This will help the marketing team make informed decisions about which YouTubers to collaborate with for their marketing campaigns.

### User story
As the Head of Marketing, I want to use a dashboard that analyses YouTube channel data in the UK.
This dashboard should allow me to identify the top performing channels based on metrics like subscriber base and average views.

With this information, I can make more informed decisions about which Youtubers are right to collaborate with, and therefore maximize how effective each marketing campaign is.

### Data source

#### Dashboard components required

- What should the dashboard contain based on the requirements provided?
  
To understand what it should contain, we need to figure out what questions we need the dashboard to answer:

1.Who are the top 10 YouTubers with the most subscribers?
2.Which 3 channels have uploaded the most videos?
3.Which 3 channels have the most views?
4.Which 3 channels have the highest average views per video?
5.Which 3 channels have the highest views per subscriber ratio?
6.Which 3 channels have the highest subscriber engagement rate per video uploaded?

For now, these are some of the questions we need to answer, this may change as we progress down our analysis.
