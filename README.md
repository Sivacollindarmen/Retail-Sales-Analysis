# Sales Revenue Analysis

### Project Overview
Management seeks to gain comprehensive insights into the sales activities of the company from 2016 to 2018. This includes understanding trends and patterns that can inform strategic decisions. Detailed information on revenue generated per region, store, product category, and brand is essential. Additionally, identifying top customers and sales representatives will provide valuable insights into performance and opportunities for targeted improvements.

### Data Acquisition
To address the business problem and meet the stated objectives, I need to acquire and compile the correct dataset.
I will start by acquiring data from the company's sales database. This is a MS SQL Database.
- Data Points Required
  - order_id, customer name, city, state, order_date, total_unit, revenue, product_name, category_name,brand_name, store_name, sale_rep
